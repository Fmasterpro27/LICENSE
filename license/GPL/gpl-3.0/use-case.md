# When Should You Use GPL?

GPL is best when you want:

- Strong open-source guarantees
- No proprietary forks
- Community-driven development
- Software freedom preservation

Good examples:
- Operating systems
- Compilers
- Developer tools
- System utilities

Avoid GPL if:
- You want closed-source derivatives
- You want easy corporate adoption
- You are building proprietary SaaS
