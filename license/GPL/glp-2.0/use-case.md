# When Should You Use GPL-2.0?

GPL-2.0 is best when you want:

- Strong open-source protection
- No closed-source derivatives
- Community-driven development

Good examples:
- Operating systems (e.g., Linux kernel)
- Compilers
- System utilities
- Core infrastructure software

Avoid GPL-2.0 if:
- You want easy corporate adoption
- You want permissive reuse
- You are building proprietary software
