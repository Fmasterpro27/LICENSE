# When Should You Use MPL-2.0?

MPL-2.0 is best when you want:

- Partial copyleft
- Legal clarity
- Patent protection
- Business-friendly open source

Good examples:
- Browsers
- Developer tools
- Libraries
- Large mixed-license projects

Avoid MPL-2.0 if:
- You want full copyleft (GPL)
- You want zero obligations (MIT)
