                   GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this
 License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
 modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This
 is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero
 has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing
 under this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
 License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
 of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.  "Object Code" means any non-source form of a
 work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
 to control those activities.

  1. Source Code.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
 work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.

  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
 having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
 with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which
 you do not control copyright.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
 code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
 give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding
 Source.

  7. Additional Terms.

  Additional permissions may be added to a covered work.  Additional
 permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated
 as though they were included in this License.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.

  11. Patents.

  A contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted under this License.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify
 the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 interacting with it remotely through a computer network an
 opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by
 providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at
 no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
 copying of software.

  This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for
 any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that
 is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.

                            NO WARRANTY

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
