# What is CC0?

CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) is a license that places a work as close as
possible to the public domain.

When a creator applies CC0 to their work, they are saying:

"You can use this for anything, without asking me."

CC0 is commonly used for:
- datasets
- audio samples
- images
- text corpora
- AI training data

CC0 is **not** a traditional license — it is a rights waiver.
