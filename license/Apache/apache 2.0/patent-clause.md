# Apache 2.0 Patent Grant

Apache 2.0 includes an explicit patent license from contributors.

This means:
- Contributors grant users rights to their patents
- Users are protected from patent lawsuits by contributors
- If a user sues over patents, their license is terminated

This is the main reason companies prefer Apache 2.0 over MIT.
