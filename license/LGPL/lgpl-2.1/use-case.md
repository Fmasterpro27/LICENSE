# When Should You Use LGPL-2.1?

LGPL-2.1 is best when you want:

- Wide adoption of a library
- Allow use in proprietary software
- Prevent closed-source modifications of the library

Good examples:
- System libraries
- Media libraries
- Math and utility libraries
- Runtime libraries

Avoid LGPL-2.1 if:
- You want full copyleft (use GPL)
- You want full permissive freedom (use MIT/Apache)
