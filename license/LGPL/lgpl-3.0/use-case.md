# When Should You Use LGPL-3.0?

LGPL-3.0 is best when you want:

- Modern legal protections
- Weak copyleft for libraries
- Patent protection
- Compatibility with GPL-3.0 projects

Good examples:
- Runtime libraries
- Middleware
- Shared system libraries
- Cross-platform SDKs

Avoid LGPL-3.0 if:
- You want very simple licensing (MIT)
- You want strong copyleft (GPL)
