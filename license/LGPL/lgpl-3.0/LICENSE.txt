                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
 the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
 License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users.

  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary GNU General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
 below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
 you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
 new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender them.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
 if you modify it.

  Developers that use the GNU LGPL protect your rights with a two-step
 method: (1) they copyright the library, and (2) they offer you this
 License, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
 modify the library.

  A library is a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
 so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
 some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the Library" and a "work that uses the Library".  The
 former contains code derived from the Library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the Library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
 GNU General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
 by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
 Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a
 mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
 Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
 Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
 Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
 based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
 object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
 data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
 from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
 Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
 without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
 facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
 that uses the facility, then you may convey a copy of the modified
 version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
    to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
 a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
 code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
 material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
 layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
 (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
    by this License.

    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
 taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
 portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
 the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices.

    d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
       this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, or

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side by side in a single library together with other library
 facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
 License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
 choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
    conveyed under the terms of this License.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Library specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have
 the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
 published version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.

                            NO WARRANTY

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
